Create a 'Next Steps' hub for your church using WordPress! Setup in minutes, mobile first & responsive & designed to integrate with your existing WordPress site!

== Description ==
WP Church Center enables churches to set up a central hub of next steps for their members. 
Unlimited cards to inform your members and make it easy for them to get involved, signup, or find out more.

Features include:
- 4 layout options (grid, small card, list, and card views)
- Colour customization options
- Header and footer customization options
- Cards utilise and display any kind of WordPress content
- Mobile first and fully responsive
- Works as standalone site, or as part of your existing WordPress site

Check out a demo at [http://wpchurch.center/hub/](http://wpchurch.center/hub/)

== Installation ==
1). Download the plugin

2). Install the plugin by either:
extracting the .zip file and uploading the entire wp-church-center folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory of our web server.
go to Plugins > Add New in the WordPress Admin and upload the .zip file.

3). Activate the Plugin. You should see a 'Cards' menu item.
You'll need to set up some settings for your centre in the 'Church Center' section of the Customizer (Appearance > Customizer). These will allow you to alter the appearance of your hub - editing the header, footer and other details of how things look.

4). If you're having 'page not found' issues when trying to view single cards - try saving your permalinks under Settings > Permalinks.



Add/Edit Cards in the same way you would with any other content
Add a page which uses the 'Church Center Homepage' template
